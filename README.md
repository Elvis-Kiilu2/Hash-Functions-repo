# Hash Functions Repository

This repository is a collection of resources, and code examples about hash functions, created as part of my Computer Networks and Security class.

## Contents
- **Examples**: Code implementations of popular hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-256).
- **Resources**: Links to articles, videos, and tools for further learning.

## What is a Hash Function?
A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or \"message\") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a hash value or digest. Hash functions are widely used in cryptography, data integrity checks, and data structures like hash tables.

## Examples
Check out the \`examples/\` directory for code implementations of hash functions in Python.
